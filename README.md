Conducted a classification project on cow milk quality using a Kaggle dataset of 1,059 entries with 7 input features: pH, temperature, taste, smell, fat, turbidity, and color. The quality was categorized into three classes: High, Medium, and Low.

Implemented a backpropagation algorithm using 7 input nodes corresponding to each variable, and 3 output nodes representing the milk quality classes. Binary features (taste, smell, fat, turbidity) were encoded as 0 or 1 based on optimal conditions, while pH and temperature were used as continuous values.
